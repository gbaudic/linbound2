# LinBound2

LinBound aims to be an open-source clone of the game [GunBound](http://gunbound.softnyx.net), a multiplayer turn-based arcade game with a gameplay very close to Worms, Hedgewars or WarMUX. It is primarily targeted to Linux but it aims to be as cross-platform as possible. 

## Documentation

## Dependencies

Linbound uses SDL2, SDL2_image, SDL2_ttf, SDL2_mixer, SDL2_net and SDL2_gfx. It also relies on TinyXML2 for XML processing. GUI subsystem will be handled by guisan (https://github.com/gbaudic/guisan).
